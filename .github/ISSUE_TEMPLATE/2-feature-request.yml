        Is Kimi CLI missing a feature that you'd like to see? Feel free to propose it here.

        Before you submit a feature:
        1. Search existing issues for similar features. If you find one, üëç it rather than opening a new one.
        2. The Kimi CLI team will try to balance the varying needs of the community when prioritizing or rejecting new features. Please understand that not all features will be accepted.
