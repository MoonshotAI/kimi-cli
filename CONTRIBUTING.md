# Contributing to Kimi CLI

Thank you for being interested in contributing to Kimi CLI!

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including bug fixes, features, document improvements, typo fixes, etc. However, as a rapidly evolving project, we highly recommend [raising an issue](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/issues) to discuss about it before you start to work on something that may have significant impacts on the codebase or user experience. This kind of discussion can avoid conflicts between the community contributions and our internal roadmap.
