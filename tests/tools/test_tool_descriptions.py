Start a subagent instance to work on a focused task.

The Agent tool can either create a new subagent instance or resume an existing one by `agent_id`.
Each instance keeps its own context history under the current session, so repeated use of the same
instance can preserve previous findings and work.

**Available Built-in Agent Types**

- `mocker`: The mock agent for testing purposes. (Tools: *, Model: inherit, Background: yes).

**Usage**

- Always provide a short `description` (3-5 words).
- Use `subagent_type` to select a built-in agent type. If omitted, `coder` is used.
- Use `model` when you need to override the built-in type's default model or the parent agent's current model.
- Use `resume` when you want to continue an existing instance instead of starting a new one.
- If an existing subagent already has relevant context or the task is a continuation of its prior work, prefer `resume` over creating a new instance.
- Default to foreground execution. Use `run_in_background=true` only when the task can continue independently, you do not need the result immediately, and there is a clear benefit to returning control before it finishes.
- Be explicit about whether the subagent should write code or only do research.
- The subagent result is only visible to you. If the user should see it, summarize it yourself.

**Explore Agent — Preferred for Codebase Research**

When you need to understand the codebase before making changes, fixing bugs, or planning features,
prefer `subagent_type="explore"` over doing the search yourself. The explore agent is optimized for
fast, read-only codebase investigation. Use it when:
- Your task will clearly require more than 3 search queries
- You need to understand how a module, feature, or code path works
- You are about to enter plan mode and want to gather context first
- You want to investigate multiple independent questions — launch multiple explore agents concurrently

When calling explore, specify the desired thoroughness in the prompt:
- "quick": targeted lookups — find a specific file, function, or config value
- "medium": understand a module — how does auth work, what calls this API
- "thorough": cross-cutting analysis — architecture overview, dependency mapping, multi-module investigation

**When Not To Use Agent**

- Reading a known file path
- Searching a small number of known files
- Tasks that can be completed in one or two direct tool calls

Send a message to the past, just like sending a D-Mail in Steins;Gate.

This tool is provided to enable you to proactively manage the context. You can see some `user` messages with text `CHECKPOINT {checkpoint_id}` wrapped in `<system>` tags in the context. When you feel there is too much irrelevant information in the current context, you can send a D-Mail to revert the context to a previous checkpoint with a message containing only the useful information. When you send a D-Mail, you must specify an existing checkpoint ID from the before-mentioned messages.

Typical scenarios you may want to send a D-Mail:

- You read a file, found it very large and most of the content is not relevant to the current task. In this case you can send a D-Mail immediately to the checkpoint before you read the file and give your past self only the useful part.
- You searched the web, the result is large.
  - If you got what you need, you may send a D-Mail to the checkpoint before you searched the web and put only the useful result in the mail message.
  - If you did not get what you need, you may send a D-Mail to tell your past self to try another query.
- You wrote some code and it did not work as expected. You spent many struggling steps to fix it but the process is not relevant to the ultimate goal. In this case you can send a D-Mail to the checkpoint before you wrote the code and give your past self the fixed version of the code and tell yourself no need to write it again because you already wrote to the filesystem.

After a D-Mail is sent, the system will revert the current context to the specified checkpoint, after which, you will no longer see any messages which you can now see after that checkpoint. The message in the D-Mail will be appended to the end of the context. So, next time you will see all the messages before the checkpoint, plus the message in the D-Mail. You must make it very clear in the message, tell your past self what you have done/changed, what you have learned and any other information that may be useful, so that your past self can continue the task without confusion and will not repeat the steps you have already done.

You must understand that, unlike D-Mail in Steins;Gate, the D-Mail you send here will not revert the filesystem or any external state. That means, you are basically folding the recent messages in your context into a single message, which can significantly reduce the waste of context window.

When sending a D-Mail, DO NOT explain to the user. The user do not care about this. Just explain to your past self.

Manage your todo list for tracking task progress.

Todo list is a simple yet powerful tool to help you get things done. You typically want to use this tool when the given task involves multiple subtasks/milestones, or, multiple tasks are given in a single request. This tool can help you to break down the task and track the progress.

**Usage modes:**

- **Update mode**: Pass `todos` to set the entire todo list. The previous list is replaced.
- **Query mode**: Omit `todos` (or pass null) to retrieve the current todo list without changes.
- **Clear mode**: Pass an empty array `[]` to clear all todos.

This is the only todo list tool available to you. That said, each time you want to update the todo list, you need to provide the whole list. Make sure to maintain the todo items and their statuses properly.

Once you finished a subtask/milestone, remember to update the todo list to reflect the progress. Also, you can give yourself a self-encouragement to keep you motivated.

Abusing this tool to track too small steps will just waste your time and make your context messy. For example, here are some cases you should not use this tool:

- When the user just simply ask you a question. E.g. "What language and framework is used in the project?", "What is the best practice for x?"
- When it only takes a few steps/tool calls to complete the task. E.g. "Fix the unit test function 'test_xxx'", "Refactor the function 'xxx' to make it more solid."
- When the user prompt is very specific and the only thing you need to do is brainlessly following the instructions. E.g. "Replace xxx to yyy in the file zzz", "Create a file xxx with content yyy."

However, do not get stuck in a rut. Be flexible. Sometimes, you may try to use todo list at first, then realize the task is too simple and you can simply stop using it; or, sometimes, you may realize the task is complex after a few steps and then you can start using todo list to break it down.

IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool repeatedly without making real progress on at least one task between calls. If you are unsure about the current state, use Query mode (omit `todos`) to check before updating. If you find yourself unable to advance any task with your available tools, inform the user about what is blocking you instead of replanning. Repeatedly updating the todo list without doing actual work is counterproductive.

Execute a bash (`/bin/bash`) command. Use this tool to explore the filesystem, edit files, run scripts, get system information, etc.

**Output:**
The stdout and stderr will be combined and returned as a string. The output may be truncated if it is too long. If the command failed, the exit code will be provided in a system tag.

If `run_in_background=true`, the command will be started as a background task and this tool will return a task ID instead of waiting for command completion. When doing that, you must provide a short `description`. You will be automatically notified when the task completes. Use `TaskOutput` for a non-blocking status/output snapshot, and only set `block=true` when you explicitly want to wait for completion. Use `TaskStop` only if the task must be cancelled. For human users in the interactive shell, background tasks are managed through `/task` only; do not suggest `/task list`, `/task output`, `/task stop`, `/tasks`, or any other invented shell subcommands.

**Guidelines for safety and security:**
- Each shell tool call will be executed in a fresh shell environment. The shell variables, current working directory changes, and the shell history is not preserved between calls.
- The tool call will return after the command is finished. You shall not use this tool to execute an interactive command or a command that may run forever. For possibly long-running commands, you shall set `timeout` argument to a reasonable value.
- Avoid using `..` to access files or directories outside of the working directory.
- Avoid modifying files outside of the working directory unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Never run commands that require superuser privileges unless explicitly instructed to do so.

**Guidelines for efficiency:**
- For multiple related commands, use `&&` to chain them in a single call, e.g. `cd /path && ls -la`
- Use `;` to run commands sequentially regardless of success/failure
- Use `||` for conditional execution (run second command only if first fails)
- Use pipe operations (`|`) and redirections (`>`, `>>`) to chain input and output between commands
- Always quote file paths containing spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "/path with spaces/")
- Use `if`, `case`, `for`, `while` control flows to execute complex logic in a single call.
- Verify directory structure before create/edit/delete files or directories to reduce the risk of failure.
- Prefer `run_in_background=true` for long-running builds, tests, watchers, or servers when you need the conversation to continue before the command finishes.
- After starting a background task, do not guess its outcome. Rely on the automatic completion notification whenever possible. Use `TaskOutput` for non-blocking progress snapshots by default, and set `block=true` only when you intentionally want to wait.
- If you need to tell a human shell user how to manage background tasks, only mention `/task`. Do not invent `/task list`, `/task output`, `/task stop`, or `/tasks`.

**Commands available:**
- Shell environment: cd, pwd, export, unset, env
- File system operations: ls, find, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, touch, chmod, chown
- File viewing/editing: cat, grep, head, tail, diff, patch
- Text processing: awk, sed, sort, uniq, wc
- System information/operations: ps, kill, top, df, free, uname, whoami, id, date
- Network operations: curl, wget, ping, telnet, ssh
- Archive operations: tar, zip, unzip
- Other: Other commands available in the shell environment. Check the existence of a command by running `which <command>` before using it.

Find files and directories using glob patterns. This tool supports standard glob syntax like `*`, `?`, and `**` for recursive searches.

- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., all Python files: `*.py`)
- Search for files recursively in subdirectories (e.g., `src/**/*.js`)
- Locate configuration files (e.g., `*.config.*`, `*.json`)
- Find test files (e.g., `test_*.py`, `*_test.go`)

- `*.py` - All Python files in current directory
- `src/**/*.js` - All JavaScript files in src directory recursively
- `test_*.py` - Python test files starting with "test_"
- `*.config.{js,ts}` - Config files with .js or .ts extension

**Bad example patterns:**
- `**`, `**/*.py` - Any pattern starting with '**' will be rejected. Because it would recursively search all directories and subdirectories, which is very likely to yield large result that exceeds your context size. Always use more specific patterns like `src/**/*.py` instead.
- `node_modules/**/*.js` - Although this does not start with '**', it would still highly possible to yield large result because `node_modules` is well-known to contain too many directories and files.
